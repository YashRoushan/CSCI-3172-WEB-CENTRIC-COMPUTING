I had this comments in the previous submission by the marker (Dave Chuck / dchuck@dal.ca ):

ALL JS MUST BE EXTERNAL!
Area of Circle - 8/10 (Math.pow shouldâ€™ve been used)
Understanding scope of const - 10/10
Arithmetic - 40/40
Area of rectangle - 10/10
Intro of let & const - 5/5
Git - 15/15
Timberlea - 10/10


//
I have improved all the things that were required to be improved in this lab, which means I have used Math.pow to solve this lab to find the area of the circle.
I have also made all the JS EXTERNAL!

As directed in the instructions this txt file contains all the necessary documentations for Lab2. I have not made any UI for the lab2 as it was not recommended in the lab instructions

## Deployment

## Sources Used

1) Apart from the brightspace and my knowledge of csci 1170, I have used different websites like w3Schools for sake of learning and revision. 

There is no link to my work that is being taken from CSCI1170. I have made my lab from the scratch

2) I already have a good knowledge of MERN STACK and have made some projects in it, I have learnt most of my JavaScript syntax from the MERN Stack Course on Udemy.
