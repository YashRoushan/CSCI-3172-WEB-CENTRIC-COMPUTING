## Sources Used

1) Apart from the brightspace and my knowledge of csci 1170, I have used different websites like w3Schools for sake of learning and revision. 

There is no link to my work that is being taken from CSCI1170. I have made my lab from the scratch

2) I already have a good knowledge of MERN STACK and have made some projects in it, I have learnt most of my JavaScript syntax from the MERN Stack Course on Udemy.
